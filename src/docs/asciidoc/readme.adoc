Purpose
~~~~~~~

An IPAM micro-service that persists network/VLAN settings, and static IP reservation system.

The virtualnetwork (IPAM) Docker container is a spring-boot micro-service that allows a user to define one or more logical virtual networks with associated IPV4 network definitions for later use.  It performs basic validation and persists network/VLAN IP configuration data, to include any optional Static IP ranges.  The entered data is persisted in a postgres database (linked or attached via settings).  

Also provided is API's  for reserving and assigning Static IP addresses that may be associated with a network configuration.  

To optionally secure the REST endpoints, the micro-service comes compiled with spring-security-oauth2 libraries, and endpoints have pre-defined roles annotated.

The micro-service also serves as a reference implementation for a stand-alone virtualnetwork JAR library (https://github.com/RackHD/smi-lib-virtualnetwork) that can be used independently when writing your own implementation. 

How to Use
~~~~~~~~~~

A docker container for this service is available at: 
https://hub.docker.com/r/rackhd/virtualnetwork/

Option 1. Linking to a postgres database:
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

1. Start the postgres database first
....
docker run --name postgresql -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=foo -d postgres:9.6.1-alpine
....
2. Start the virtualnetwork docker container with the link option
....
sudo docker run --name virtualnetwork -p 0.0.0.0:46016:46016 --link=postgresql:db -e SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=linked -e DB_POSTGRES_PASSWORD=foo -d rackhd/virtualnetwork:latest
....

Option 2. Passing connection settings in with the environment tag:
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

....
docker run --name virtualnetwork -p 0.0.0.0:46016:46016 -e DB_POSTGRES_PASSWORD=foo -e DB_PORT_5432_TCP_PORT=5432 -e DB_PORT_5432_TCP_ADDR=1.2.3.4 -d rackhd/virtualnetwork:latest
....

Option 3. Docker Compose (without Conusl K/V store) example:
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=Dell123$$
....

Option 4. Docker Compose using Conusl K/V store for properties example:
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

....
version: '2'

services:
  virtualnetwork:
    container_name: virtualnetwork

    depends_on:
    - consul
    - postgresql
    network_mode: "host"
    ports:
    - 46016:46016
    extra_hosts:
    - "service-registry:<<replace with consul ip address>>"
    volumes:
    - /var/log/dell/:/var/log/dell/
    #- /etc/ssl/:/etc/ssl
    mem_limit: 512m
    environment:
    - "SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=consul"
    - _JAVA_OPTIONS=-Xmx64m -Xss256k

  postgresql:
    container_name: postgresql
    image: postgres:9.6.1-alpine
    ports:
    - 5432:5432
    mem_limit: 512m
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=Dell123$$
....

Example Usage Scenario
++++++++++++++++++++++

A typical flow could be that a quantity of IP addresses is needed for potential use by an entity during a workflow, or other business logic of the consuming application.

Step 1.  The user or application makes a call to the micro-service to persist the configuration for one or more networks.  For this scenario, one or more of the networks is configured with a static IP range.

....
{
 "name":"Network1",
 "description":"The First Network",
 "type":[] /*Enum (PUBLIC_LAN,PRIVATE_LAN,STORAGE_ISCSI_SAN,STORAGE_FCOE_SAN,OOB_OR_INFRASTRUCTURE_MANAGEMENT,HYPERVISOR_MANAGEMENT,HYPERVISOR_MIGRATION,HYPERVISOR_CLUSTER_PRIVATE,PXE,FILESHARE,FIP_SNOOPING,HARDWARE_MANAGEMENT)*/,
 "vlanId":90, // Allowed values are 1 to 4000 from UI. Values above 4000 are reserved for ICEE. VlanId for OOB_OR_INFRASTRUCTURE_MANAGEMENT networks must be empty or null.
 "static":true,
 "staticIpv4NetworkConfiguration":
    {
        "gateway":"172.162.0.1",
        "subnet":"255.255.255.0",
        "dnsSuffix":"abc.com",
        "primaryDns":"172.162.0.1",
        "secondaryDns":"172.162.0.2",
        "ipRange":
        [
                {
                    "startingIp":"172.162.0.90",
                    "endingIp":"172.162.0.92" // Maximum number of ip addresses allowed per range is 1000.
                }
                {} /* one or more*/
         
        ]
    }
}
....

Example payload (above) - can be used with REST "POST" to endpoint "/api/1.0/networks"

Step 2.  The user or application makes a call to the micro-service to lookup previously entered network configuration data as a list, by Name, or by Type.

Step 3. The user makes a call to the micro-service to RESERVE N number of IP addresses from network X for a process with identifier Y.   The micro-service returns an array of IP addresses to fulfill the request, or an error.

Step 4.  The user makes a call to the micro-service to ASSIGN IP address A from network X to Usage ID Z1.

Step 5.  The user makes another call to the micro-service to ASSIGN IP address B from network X to Usage ID Z2.

Step 6. The user determines that he does not need IP address C.  A call is made to the micro-service to RELEASE IP address C from network X.  Alternatively, a call can be made by an external process to release any reserved IP addresses that are not assigned within a given expiration period.
